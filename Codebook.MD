### Additional Transformations are included below:

1. Duplicate columns in Training and Test were removed. 
2. Numeric Activity Labels were transformed in verbose text for easy understanding
3. Numeric Participant Labels were transformed into Verbose text for easy reporting
4. Abbreviated Column names that begin with "t" were transformed to begin with "time"
5. Abbreviated column names that begin with "f" were transforemed to being with "freq"
6. Abbreviation "mag" in column names were modified to be "magnititude" for easy assimilation

Thanks.
